# Enjoy Xcode a little bit more
The [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) theme is beautiful in its simplicity. Its
minimalistic, yet expressive, colors scheme has led it to become popular amongst modern vim users. 
This intends to be a faithful implementation of the original for Xcode.

# Install

The theme needs to be placed in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`.
If you are lazy you can copy this into your terminal 
`ruby -e $(curl -fssL [INSTALL])`
